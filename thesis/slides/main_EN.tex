    \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Problem Motivation*:}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Containers}} have become the go-to alternative for sandboxing and deploying distributed applications, they build on the concept of \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{namespaces}}.
        \item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_checkpointing}{Checkpointing} provides systems with \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{fault-tolerance}} and \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{state consistency}} enabling rollback and restore from previous stable versions.
        \item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Live migration}} consists in transparently relocating running services for improved resource-management and increased QoS.
        \item Support for checkpointing containers is very limited (\href{https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/master/experimental/checkpoint-restore.md}{[Link 1]}, \href{https://criu.org/Docker}{[Link 2]}) and only in experimental mode. 
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{alertblock}{Main Goal}
        Design, implementation, and evaluation of a \sout{distributed} checkpoint/restore technique for \textcolor{red}{established TCP connections} between processes and runC containers.
    \end{alertblock}

    \framesubtitle{What is a runC Container?}

    \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Introduction to runC:}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{runc}} is a tool to spawn containers according to the OCI specification.
        \item Rather than \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{images}}, it relies on OCI bundles: \texttt{config.json} + \texttt{rootfs}.
        \item It sits at the core of most container engines as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:runc}.
    \end{itemize}

            \textbf{Checkpoint/Restore:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Checkpointing}} is a technique to \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{save}} the state of a running process.
                \item The \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{state}} is made up of: memory, pipes, sockets, ...
                \item This state is used to \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{restore}} the process.
                \item Originated in HPC and popularized through Virtual Machines.
                \item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace)}} is a tool to perform C/R from userspace transparently to the user.

            \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Checkpoint/Restore of Unix sockets:}} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item We rely on \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{CRIU}} to perform C/R from userspace, \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{transparently}} to the user.
                \item To \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{checkpoint}}, CRIU gathers information from FDT and dumps the content.
                \item To \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{restore}}, it depends on the socket state:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \texttt{LISTEN}: restore as any other file.
                    \item \texttt{CONNECTED}:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Establish a listening anon. socket.
                        \item Create a socket at the desired FD (dumped one).
                        \item Connect to the fake end and call \texttt{dup2}.
                    \end{enumerate}
                \end{itemize}
            \item We need to bind to the \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{same}} IP address.
            \item Inbound packets are dropped by the netfilter in Table~\ref{table:filter}.

                \begin{itemize}

                    \item Manually compress and migrate image files.
