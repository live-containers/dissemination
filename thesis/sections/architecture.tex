\chapter{\projName (think of a name for the system)} \label{chap:system}

In this chapter I would present the majority of the work we have done.
From a design perspective, implementation, and evaluation.

\section{Building Blocks}

My idea is to first go one-by-one the different experiments we have done, namely: iterative migration, memory deduplication, remote migration, tcp connections, ...
The work for this part (other than the evaluation) is mostly done.

For each one, present:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A bit of the theory behind it
    \item A basic proof of concept (maybe even bash scripts)
    \item Integration with \texttt{runc} and our system (yet to be named)
    \item A micro-benchmark of this feature.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Diskless Migration}

\subsection{Iterative Migration}

Again:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Theory
    \item Design
    \item Basic PoC
    \item Integration
    \item Evaluation \& Benchmarking
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Aside: Memory Deduplication}

Maybe not an aside, but putting it here to remember

\subsection{Remote Migration}

\subsection{Checkpointing TCP Connections}

\subsubsection*{Aside: Checkpointing Established TCP Connections}

\section{Checkpointing Multiple Containers}

To be done.
A necessary first step is to manage the namespaces and IPs as we do now.

\section{Putting it All Together}

A bit of a walkthrough of the final implementation
