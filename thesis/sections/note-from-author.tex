The work here presented is my Master's Thesis for the Master in Advanced Mathematics and Statistics, from the School of Mathematics in the Technical University of Catalonia (FME-UPC).
It has been developed during a year-long collaboration with Jordi Guitart, from the Computer Architecture Department, who has lead the development and advised my research.
Part of this work has been funded by a research collaboration grant \textit{"beca de colÂ·laboraci\'o en departaments universitaris - Curs 2019-2020"} funded by the \textit{"Ministerio de eduaci\'on y formaci\'on profesional"}.
