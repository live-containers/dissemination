\chapter{Evaluation} \label{chap:evaluation}

In the previous chapter, \S\ref{chap:system}, we have presented our implementation of live migration of containers using \criu and \runc, and have motivated our design choices with micro-benchmarks that fulfil the initial objectives specified in the introduction.

In this chapter, we move on to evaluate the system as a whole, and how the different features interlace and work together, and  how does our system compare to traditional virtual machine live migration.

\section{Macro-Benchmarks}

\subsection{Iterative, Remote, Diskless Migration}

Goal here would be to have the diagram we went over once, in which we plot over time the amount of memory we send.

\cs{Re-do the initial plot presented}

\subsection{Checkpointing TCP Connections inside Network Namespaces}

\cs{Include the content from Decentralized Systems}

\section{Comparison with Virtual Machines Migration}

\cs{Recreate the plot in ~\cite{Clark2005}}

\section{Scalability}
