\chapter{Evaluation} \label{chap:evaluation}

In the previous chapter, \S\ref{chap:system}, we have presented our implementation of live migration of containers using \criu and \runc, and have motivated our design choices with micro-benchmarks that fulfil the initial objectives specified in the introduction.
In this chapter, we move on to evaluate the system as a whole, and how the different features interlace and work together, and  how does our system compare to traditional virtual machine live migration.

In all the experiments here presented, and unless otherwise stated, we use the same experimental setup than in the micro-benchmark chapter.
Two (if necessary) Linux Debian machines with kernel version $4.19.0-6$ running on a host-only network in VirtualBox version $5.2.34$.
\criu version $3.13$ and \runc version $1.0.0-rc8$, both built from source.

\section{Memory Scalability}

In this section we study the scalability of our approach with respect to the memory allocated by the to-be checkpointed container.
For this experiment we set up a \textsc{Redis} in-memory database which we pre-load with a variable number of key-value pairs.
We use \texttt{redis-client} and \texttt{redis-server} version $5.0.3$, and pre-load the keys using
