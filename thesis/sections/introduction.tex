\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}

\jg{Apart from the context and motivation of the work, do not forget to include here a clear list of the objectives of the thesis}.

\jg{In order to drive the explanation of Section \ref{chap:system} it could be useful if you identify here a list of requirements that the system has to fulfill (e.g. minimize downtime while migrating memory-intensive containers, keep TCP connections open, etc)}.

\jg{Some master theses also include some planning and effort/cost analysis. Check if this applies for MAMME theses}.
