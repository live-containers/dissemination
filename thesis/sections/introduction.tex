\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}

\cs{This section still needs to be phrased together}
\jg{This needs a good elaboration of the text. My feeling now is that there is some mixing among objectives and tasks here. We should detail both, but providing a clear rationale. For instance, accomplishing the goal 'Minimize downtime and resource utilization of memory-intensive applications' requires a task on 'supporting iterative migration'. Similarly, the task 'Support for established TCP connections' is necessary because one of the goals is the 'ability to live migrate distributed container deployments'.}

Introduction/motivation

This Master thesis is an initial approach to live migration of distributed container deployments.
We first study the different tools to checkpoint and restore containers and their integration with different container engines.
Then, we provide a proof of concept implementation of live migration of running and connected containers transparently to the end user.
In particular we make use of \criu (Checkpoint-Restore in Userspace) 

The main goal of this work is to implement efficient live migration of running containers.
The terms \textit{efficient} and \textit{live} are vague in the absence of concise metrics, and the variety of running containers is also huge, as a consequence we specify a set of objectives we want our system to fulfill.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimize downtime and resource utilization of live migrations of memory-intensive applications.
\end{itemize}

In order to support the previously mentioned objectives, we set up a series of specifications our implementation must fulfil.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Support for established TCP connections
    \item Support for C/R of namespaces
\end{itemize}

The contributions of this work are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An exhaustive micro-evaluation of different \criu features, their performance, and their integration with \runc.
    \item An open-source library for live migration of \runc containers using \criu.
    \item An evaluation of our solution when compared to virtual machine migration.
\end{itemize}

The structure of the rest of this document is as follows:
