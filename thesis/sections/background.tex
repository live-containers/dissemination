\chapter{Background Concepts} \label{chap:background}

\section{Containers} \label{sec:containers}

Jordi, you might add comments using \texttt{\textbackslash jg} command \jg{like this}.

An Introduction to containers, what are they used for, some data, ...

\subsection{An Introduction to Virtualization}

Introduce the concepts of virtualization and process isolation, what is a virtual machine

\subsection{Working Principles of Containers}

Relatively deep dive into containers:

\subsubsection*{Control Groups}

\subsubsection*{Namespaces}

\subsubsection*{Putting it all together}

Mention the different alternatives for container runtimes

\subsection{Container Orchestrators}

\jg{We are not focusing on orchestrators in the thesis, so this section might not be necessary. In fact, their support for checkpointing and migration depends on the underlying containerization engine and, as far as I know, none of them exploits this functionality. Orchestrators might have a relevant role for distributed checkpointing (we could mention this), but again, I am not aware of any orchestrator providing that. We might do some investigation to confirm.}

\subsection{State-of-the-Art for Virtualization Techniques}

\jg{Same comment here. I do not think this is needed as background for the thesis.}

Mention some novel techniques in the area:

- Microkernels

- Lightweight VM

- Serverless

- Cloud native

\section{Checkpointing}

Brief introduction, what is checkpointing

\subsection{Checkpoint-Restore}

\subsection{Live Migration}

Iterative, pre-copy, post-copy, ... \cite{Clark2005}

\subsection{Distributed Checkpointing}

\section{\criu: Checkpoint Restore in Userspace}

Given how heavily our project relies on CRIU, I figured out we could devote a section to it.
Here I will depict the architecture, how it works, and who uses it, together with some of it's most important features.

\subsection{A Technical Overview on \criu}

\subsection{Comparison with Other C/R Tools}

We can beneffit from this table:

- \url{https://criu.org/Comparison_to_other_CR_projects}

Compare:

- VM C/R

- CRIU

- DMTCP

- BLCR

- FTI: maybe this falls a bit out of the scope \url{https://github.com/leobago/fti}

We could also include snippets of how to run a Hello World for each alternative.
