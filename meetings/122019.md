### Friday December 20th Meeting

**Get a development workflow**
+ Done
+ Compile & Code Localhost (w/ my current Docker version)
+ Run @ VM (w/ specific kernel and criu version)

**What is the temporal cost of doing a live migration?**

**How does the live migration work under the hood?**
+ The output of running: `grep -r "criu" .` in the moby source has the following matches:
    * `/vendor/github.com/containerd/go-runc/runc.go`: prototyping of the methods and arguments they take.
    * `./vendor/github.com/containerd/containerd/runtime/linux/runctypes/runc.pb.go`: settings for protobuffers.
    * `./vendor/github.com/containerd/containerd/runtime/v1/shim/service.go`:
    * `./vendor/github.com/containerd/containerd/pkg/process/init.go`:

**Check Slide 76 on the PWP**

**Diskless Migration**

+ Interesting Series of Articles:
    - [Introduction to CRIU](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/checkpointrestore-container-migration):
        * CRIU interfaces the kernel using the [PTRACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptrace) system call, injects parasite code that then accesses the process adress space.
        * With CRIU a process can only be restored with the same process identifier.
        * Limitations: exactly the same libraries on both systems (source and destination). Further, it can not migrate applications that are directly accessing hardware.
        * CRIU is specially designed to checkpoint containers.
    - [CRIU Architectural Details](https://access.redhat.com/articles/2455211?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7EAAW)
        * _"To solve the problems of these earlier implementations, CRIU takes another approach. It implements as much functionality as possible in the user space and uses existing interfaces to implement checkpoint/restore succesfully."_
        * Most importatntly, CRIU relies on the `ptrace` interface. It seizes the process and injects parasite code to dump the memory pages into image files.
        * To restore a process with the same PID, a newly introduced kernel interface is used to influence which PID the kernel gives to the next process.
