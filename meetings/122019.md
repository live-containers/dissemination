### Friday December 20th Meeting

**Get a development workflow**
+ Done
+ Compile & Code Localhost (w/ my current Docker version)
+ Run @ VM (w/ specific kernel and criu version)

**What is the temporal cost of doing a live migration?**

**How does the live migration work under the hood?**
+ The output of running: `grep -r "criu" .` in the moby source has the following matches:
    * `/vendor/github.com/containerd/go-runc/runc.go`: prototyping of the methods and arguments they take.
    * `./vendor/github.com/containerd/containerd/runtime/linux/runctypes/runc.pb.go`: settings for protobuffers.
    * `./vendor/github.com/containerd/containerd/runtime/v1/shim/service.go`:

**Check Slide 76 on the PWP**

**Diskless Migration**
