### Wednesday February 12th Takeaways - Work To-Do

0. Perform a local migration from different directories:
```
// Eureka container running
sudo ./migration.py \
    --name eureka \
    --restore-dir $(pwd) \
    --container-path /home/carlos/criu-demos/runc/redis
```
1. Perform a local diskless migration
2. Perform a local pre-copy/post-copy migration
    - Manually copying files to new dir
3. Repeat points 1 and 2 in a remote machine
    - Another VM, how to make them reachable?
4. Benchmark 1-4
5. Repeat Redis experiment without dropping the client's connection?
    - Study the `tcp-established` flag and what it actually does.
    - Consider Slide 89 in the PwP
    - Read the Paper Jordi gave me: `$(ROOT_CRIU)/references/man
